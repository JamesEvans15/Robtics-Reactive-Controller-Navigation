# Robtics-Reactive-Controller-Navigation

This project was completed in my Robotics and Spatial Intelligence Course in collaboration with Aidan Heffron and Rohit Shankar.

The goal of this project was seperated into 2 parts, the goal of the first part was to create a simulator for a differential drive robot equipped with a lidar sensor. With the lidar it would be able to identify objects in its direct vicinity. The second part of the project was to take this robot developed in part 1 and create a reactive control system that will navigate it through a randomly generated winding corridor.

This project was seperated into seperate folders Part 1 and Part 2, in which the folders contain the ROS code, a report describing the work completed as well as videos demonstrating the functionality.
